# AIS Chat

## Overview and purpose
AIS Chat is a messaging application built with privacy in mind. It provides a secure and ephemeral space to have text based conversations. Messages are encrypted end-to-end and only live in a per-session basis. Multiple modes of authentication are supported and users can join and create rooms to communicate with groups.
